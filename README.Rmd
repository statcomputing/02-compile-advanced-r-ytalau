## Missing Packages

I had to download some missing packages including `bench`, `lobstr`, and `emo`.


## Downloaded pandoc-citeproc

I need to install ("brew install pandoc-citeproc)
this on my laptop so that the bib file can be rendered. 


## Font Inconsolata

It seems that in the "main.tex", for the font command, one of the lines has 
"Inconsolata" with a capital "I" instead of "inconsolata".  As a result, this 
font cannot be recognized.  I modified the command in the "main.tex" file.
